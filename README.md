# What is SOFT ? #
SOFT is the acronym of Sword Object Facilities.
 
SOFT is an implementation of the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) core, and the Ecore metamodel in C++ and Go.

The current release allows to generate code from Ecore metamodels, and to parse and serialize models and metamodels from and into XMI documents. A reflective API for generated metamodels is also provided.

Soft consits of 2 parts for each langage :  a generator from Ecore metamodels, and the ecore library. The generators are currently implemented using Acceleo and Java.

# Features #
## C++ and Go features ##
* Multiple Inheritance - A class can be defined with many interfaces
* Handling of containment and opposite relations - Setting one side of a relation automatically sets the other side.
* XMI/XML serialization and deserialization of metamodel/model instances - Resource framework allows splitting of serializations, including cross-resource containment.
* Reflection - MetaModel structure is available at runtime
* Notification - Events are raised when the model is changed
* Extension - Generated code can be overriden by the user

## C++ features ##
* C++17
* Memory Management with shared pointers

# Generators #
How to execute a generator:
```
unzip soft.generator.<lang>-<version>.zip
cd soft.generator.<lang>-<version>
java -jar soft.generator.<lang>-<version>.jar -m <ecore file> -o <output directory>
```

Each generator is composed of a group of templates. These templates are listed via the command line:
```
java -jar soft.generator.<lang>-<version>.jar -h
```
You can use a specific template ( or everything except one) via the command line
```
java -jar soft.generator.<lang>-<version>.jar -t <template> !<not template>
```
