SOFT is an implementation of the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) core, and the Ecore metamodel in C++ and Go.

The current release allows to generate code from Ecore metamodels, and to parse and serialize models and metamodels from and into XMI documents. A reflective API for generated metamodels is also provided.

Soft consits of 2 parts for each langage :  a generator from Ecore metamodels to langage itself , and the ecore library. The generators are currently implemented using Acceleo and Java.
